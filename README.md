# mavis-python

MAvis is a comprehensive system designed for multi-agent pathfinding and visualization, particularly within the context of a hospital environment. This project includes a search client implemented in Python, a visualization tool using Pygame, and a level designer for creating custom levels.

For easier experimentation a helper tool for creating maps can be found here: [MAvis Level Designer](https://sebastianrmason.github.io/mavis-level-designer/).

We provide a handy notebook to help you out experimenting with different search strategies and collect benchmarks!
